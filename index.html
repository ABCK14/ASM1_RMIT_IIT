<h1> My IT Profile</h1>

<h2>Personal information</h2>
<ul>
<p>
  <center><img src="29.JPG" width="200px"></center>
  <center>My name: Nguyen Duc Khang</center>
  <center>Student number: s3824317</center>
  <center>Email: s3824317@rmit.edu.vn</center><br>
   - Hi guys, my name is Khang. I am from Viet Nam. I am a first-year student of RMIT in IT major. I can speak Vietnamese and English.<br>
   - To me, I love to build a PC, optimize it to make it better or take something apart and then put it all together, into its original form. I also play Frisbee, because it is a fantastic sport where you can increase the strength health, keep fit better and have a happy time during you play</center>
</p></ul>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<ul>

<li>My interest in IT is about how to build a system like a PC, to combine different hardware together, make or create a software to compatible with as many hardware as possible. That interest starts from when I was 3-4 years-old. Because at that time, my brother was played a video game and I really like it but I want to play it on my computer, but I realize that my computer was from an ancient time so I cannot play that game. That is the sparkle in my head and now it leads me to my main major right now.</li>

<li>The reasons for me to choose RMIT is because it has a really good environment for student to study or have better facilities than other school I knew. The other reason is in here, I can study with lots of student from around the world, have a wider relationship and know more about how is it like to work with international student to improve my teamwork skills.</li>

<li>To me, I expect to have a deeper knowledge about what actually IT is, to know more about how the IT systems works to develop my skill set to my future job</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideal job</h2>
<ul>
 <p>My ideal job: <a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/project-leader-python-cloud-panasonic-vietnam-group-panasonic-r-d-center-vietnam-prdcv-2808"> https://itviec.com/it-jobs/project-leader-python-cloud-panasonic-vietnam-group-panasonic-r-d-center-vietnam-prdcv-2808 </a>
  <br>

  <br>

 - To me, I think this position appeals to me is because I am really interested in cloud and with my ability is to help people, solve the problem between each other in the group and lead them to go in the same way to achieve a final goal.
 The job has lots of requirements to have this position:
 <ul>
  <li>Experience in software development (5 years)</li>
  <li>Experience in manager position (3 years)</li>
  <li>Full commercial application development</li>
  <li>PMP certification (Project Management Professional) is preferred</li></ul>
 - And many smaller requirement such as negotiation services and software agreements with vendors, developing desktop or API application, having 3 year experiences in cloud development by using AWS or Azure, exceptional at communication skills, have experience in Database such as JSON/MS (JSON: Java Script Object Notation) and success in strategic management, leadership, planning and organized skill required.<br>
 - In my opinion, right now, as a student in a university, I cannot have all of the requirement skill, qualifications and experiences but I still trying my best to earn all of that requirement to archive that position. Right now, I can tell that I am confident about my negotiation skill, planning and organize everything into the right places. <br>
 - I have a plan to archive all of that requirement is first of all, having a Bachelor degree of IT after 3-4 years then I will go outside to work for several year to gain more experiences to apply to that position. While I working, I will try my best to study to take some all of the certificate for the requirement of the position that I want to be.

<h2>Personal profile:</h2>

<p>
  The result of Myers-briggs test: I am an advocate INFJ-T<br>
  <center><img src="Myers-Briggs.jpg" width="500px"></center>
  <br>My online learning style test result: I am a visual learner
  <center><img src="Learning_style.jpg" width="500px"> </center>
  <br>The result of Big Five Personality test:
  <center><img src="personalities.jpg" width="500px"></center>
  - O.C.E.A.N stands for:
  <ul>
    <li>O: Openness</li>
    <li>C: Conscientiousness</li>
    <li>E: Extraversion</li>
    <li>A: Agreeableness</li>
    <li>N: Neuroticism</li></ul>
  - All of the result above tells me that I am a creative person, insightful, a visual learner<br>
  - To me, I think all of those result proves that I can become a very useful person in a team because I can have a deep knowledge about some field, which is to support not only myself but also my teammates.<br>
  -	When forming a team,  I think that all of these results and tests maybe do not exactly true to themselves. I just take it with a grain of salt to the result and I have to meet them in face to face to know exactly how others behave and how do they react to different scenario, are they friendly or not.
  <p></ul>
<h2>Project Idea:</h2>
<ul>
<p>I have an idea to create <br>
  My project is about to build a digital clock that can report the weather, the UV level and the quality of the air of everyday. To me, I think this will become very useful because me, who always stay up late at night forget to set the alarm before you go to bed, usually gets up in the morning in panic because I afraid of coming to school late. I know somewhere out there, there are many people who is in the same situation like me so I want to create a digital clock to help those people also myself to have a easier life, to become less panic, enjoy our morning in a peaceful way. As you can imagine, the clock be able to set the alarm for not only a day, a whole week but also a specific day like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday only, not include Saturday, Sunday and Thursday. The other feature is that it can tells you the weather of that day, how is the quality of the air in the city and the UV index for you to prepare yourself. This features will take less time for you to know about all the information you need to go outside rather than you have to pick up your phone, login to it, open the weather app to know the weather and the UV index, then close the weather app and open the quality air app to take a look in it. With the clock, you just have to click 1 button to see and to hear all of that information you need to have a fresh day. The clock will also alert you to bring out the rain coat or an umbrella if it is going to rain that day, or alert you to wear sunglasses and to use the sun cream if that day have a high UV index. The other feature is that it is a decoration for your bedside shelf, or your working or studying area. To create this clock, we have to use 2 main thing is a raspberry pi and arduino to collaborate with each other, and other thing such as a digital display, a mainboard, a temperature and humidity sensor, a speaker, a button and a housing create from the 3d print machine or made from anything to create the clock. All you need to create the clock is all of the hardware above and how to optimize the raspberry pi and arduino through Arduino IDE app and Python in Pycharm software to combine also operate the clock. If this project is success, you will have a product that is really use full for everyone life and you can sell it to other people who face the same problem, also you will have a knowledge of how to create, operates, interact and how to combine 2 different hardware together through some python code line or Arduino IDE app. This clock will help people to use their time more effectively, have less panic moment in the morning like me and our surroundings is changing every day, every seconds from now, this will create a huge field for people to develop their own smarthome, make it become more friendly, more helpful to themselves, make their life even more convenience than before. <br>
